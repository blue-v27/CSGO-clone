# CSGO-clone
One of the first games I've made and it very much shows in the lack of quality it displays, there are a few things that MUST be changed to make it nicer for the palyer:
- Improving the MOVEMENT and the SHADERS to make everything more responsive
- Different GUNS actually making a difference in the gameplay as well as making a better SHOP
- ENEMY AI
- FRAME RATE optimazition
- Support for LOCAL MULTIPLAYER
- Different MAPS and TEXTURES
- Reload and weapon switching ANIMATIONS
