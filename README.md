# CSGO-clone
One of the first games I've made and it very much shows in the lack of quality it displays, there are a few things that MUST be changed to make it nicer for the palyer:

-Improving the MOVEMENT and the SHADERS to make everything more responsive
-different GUNS actually making a difference in the gameplay as well as making a better SHOP
-ENEMY AI
-FRAME RATE optimazition
-support for LOCAL MULTIPLAYER
-different MAPS and TEXTURES
-reload and weapon switching ANIMATIONS
